# Forkify App - Final Project

This app is the final project of the [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course) course.[^1]

## User Story

1. As a user, I want to search for recipes, so that I can find new ideas for meals
2. As a user, I want to be able to update the number of servings, so that I can cook a meal for different number of people
3. As a user, I want to bookmark recipes, so that I can review them later
4. As a user, I want to be able to create my own recipes, so that I have them all organized in the same app
5. As a user, I want to be able to see my bookmarks and own recipes when I leave the app and come back later, so that I can close the app safely after cooking

## Features

1. Search input that queries to the API
2. Update ingredients quantity when changing number of servings
3. Bookmark action
4. Ability to add recipes (locally)
5. Save and read bookmarks from `localStorage`
